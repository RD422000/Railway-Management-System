# Railway-Management-System
The SQL script creates a Railway Management System by first setting up the database and then defining tables for stations, trains, schedules, passengers, bookings, staff, and train assignments. <br> Each table includes relevant fields, with primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity. <br> Sample data is then inserted into each table to illustrate how the system can be used. <br> This setup allows for managing railway operations, including train schedules, passenger bookings, and staff assignments. <br> The script covers creating, linking, and populating the database with initial data.
